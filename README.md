# paxos

Golang implementation of Paxos using protobuf and gRPC.
Currently implemented more as a demonstration, less for practicality.
Most of the concepts are in place.

This was largely implemented off of the Google tech talk found on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7nAGI_NZPk).
See the [notes.txt](notes.txt) file for the notes I took prior to implementing.
